Currently :
v 0.1
    one func that can add and subtract items and amounts and costs
    auto saving and loading

v 0.2
    one func used for both sales and purchases, accurates adds and subtracts amounts and costs
    auto saving and loading
    does not track revenues or profits

v 0.3
    Revenues and profits roughly tracked by adding to prof during a sale and taking away with a purchase as well as adding to revenue the price of a sale
    Started on GUI
    Financial data being loaded and displayed, fincancial data updates whenever a change is made

v 0.6
    Custom TkInter Mockup Made and UI Made
    Ability to add transactions as UI elements
    Need to hookup to the back end
    Frontend Basically complete for now
    Need to save transactions in their own format, have them load upon opening

v 0.7
    Backend fully hooked up, able to load data, change data, and save data
    need to implement way to clear all data from gui
    Transactions are now saved and loaded upon startup
    Added function to clear transaction history

    Basics all complete
    Still have two placesholders on dashboard for something

    Graph needs to be reset when data is reset
    Need to add ability to delete transactions in case of mistakes (I keep making them)

v 1.2.1
    Graph resets along with data

    stopped allowing transaction to go through if type was P/S

v 1.3
    Added ability to delete transactions
    this was hell
